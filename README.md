## Introduction

***

This repository is used for the project given by the lecture on Programming for Data Analysis module on <em><strong>Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at ATU</strong></em>. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook <code>PDA_Project_2.ipynb</code> and data files.

In this analysis, we aim to explore and visualize the CO2, temperature anomalies over the years, considering the unique reference periods for different regions. By leveraging this dataset, we seek to uncover patterns, trends, and potential correlations that contribute to a deeper understanding of climate dynamics.

### Problem Statement

For this project analysis of paleo-present climate data:

* Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.
* Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)
* Examine Irish context:
  o Climate change signals:[Maynooth study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094723000610#bib13)
* Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas
dataframe and export to csv and json formats
* For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between
them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).
* Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to
published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue
* Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-icecoverage)
