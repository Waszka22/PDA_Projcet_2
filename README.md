# PDA_Project_2


## Introduction

***

This repository is used for the project given by the lecture on Programming for Data Analysis module on <em><strong>Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at ATU</strong></em>. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook <code>PfDA_Assigment.ipynb</code> and data files.

### Problem Statement

For this project analysis of paleo-present climate data:

* Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.
* Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)
* Examine Irish context:
  o Climate change signals:[Maynooth study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094723000610#bib13)
* Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas
dataframe and export to csv and json formats
* For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between
them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).
* Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to
published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue
* Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-icecoverage)
